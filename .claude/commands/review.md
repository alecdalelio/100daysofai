Perform a pragmatic code review for: $ARGUMENTS

Instructions:
- Report issues by severity (High/Med/Low) with specific file/line refs.
- For each High/Med item, give a concrete edit suggestion aligned with `CLAUDE.md` conventions (TS strictness, shadcn, Supabase helpers).
- Implement only the clearly safe improvements now; queue riskier changes as follow-ups.

Close with a short summary of edits made and any remaining risks.
